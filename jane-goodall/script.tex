Meet Jane Goodall, one of the pioneering English primatologists. Goodall is
well known for her expansive research and dedication in order to save the lives
of chimpanzees around the world.

Her sheer passion was all thanks to Jubilee, a chimpanzee doll Goodall acquired
during her first birthday. This was what sparked Goodall's unadulterated
fascination with chimpanzees.

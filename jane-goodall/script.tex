Her sheer passion was all thanks to Jubilee, a chimpanzee doll Goodall acquired
during her first birthday. This was what sparked Goodall's unadulterated
fascination with chimpanzees.

chimpanzees and their behavior in natural habitat.

Goodall did this with the objective of helping us gain more insight into
chimpanzees and their relation with humans.
